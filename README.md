Go-Concurrency-Pattern

Concurreny is one of the most importent part of modern programming languages and Go-lang has its own unique way of handling it.
This repository is born out of the my desire to learn Go concurrency patterns. Its rather very difficult to find quality content tech specialy when internet is flooded with inexperienced influencers. Go doccumentation is excellent source for knowledge ragarding the language and also quite beautifully structured.It's easy to follow and also reference in future but the it gets rather difficult to reference code snippets from videos or talks, therefore i have currated this repository containg code snippets from all the best talks i have arround this topic.

One of such wonderfull talk was given by Rob Pike in Google I/0 2012.

So this very first iteration of Go Concurrency Patterns contain all the code snippets discussed in the above link.
It is nicely structure and documented for ease of understanding, I hope you get the very best out of it.
